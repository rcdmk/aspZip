## Usage

Include the class file in the desired page and instantiate the class

    dim zip
    set zip = new aspZip

Open a ZIP file (create or open an existing file in disk)
	
    zip.OpenArchieve("path\to\file.zip") ' this creates the archieve if it doesn't exists

Add some files or folders

    zip.Add("..\src")
    zip.Add(".\default.asp")
    
Write the files to disk

    zip.CloseArchieve()

If you want to extract the contents of a ZIP file, use the `ExtractTo(DestinationPath)` method

    zip.ExtractTo(".\test")

If the archieve contains no files, it will be deleted when the object is destroyed.
	
>**Note:**  
>In the current release (0.3) it only extracts the folder strutucture from the file. There are
some "mysterious" things happening when extracting that I could not bypass. Some kind of
access restriction imposed by Windows that even giving "Full control" access to the IIS users
it still gives the error and hangs, so I just ignored the erros for it to work without crashing
the server.
